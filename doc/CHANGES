* clients can send messages to server now
* server handles message using MessageProcessor
* added mode to "vanilla log" .. ie without ctxt and any prependers, used for header logging


to construct a player:
  * intro state has to listen to authentication succession
  * when it receives the notice, it constructs a player object with
    GUID = NetMgr->Peer->GetGuidFromSystemAddress(UNASSIGNED_SYSTEM_ADDRESS)
    Puppet = unassigned
    Username = received from event
    
* joining the queue *
  * lua transmits msg MSG_MATCH_SEARCH
  * server receives msg, and passes it to MatchFinder
  * MatchFinder queues up player
  
  
  
* added event ctor with name instead of uid
* subscription is now allowed using names instead of event ids

--- COMBAT ---
* Server:forceInstance() now pulls a profile using property assigned by player (this would be provided by account info when player properly logs in)
* Instance:Instance() now broadcasts profile names to all players
* EntityEvent: new class that holds an Owner id (a string, the one provided by instance), and an ObjectID (assigned by the instance, unique id)
* Instance:start() now sends an event "CreateProfile" to players to create puppets in game
