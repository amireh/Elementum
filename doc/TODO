-- Deployment --
* create CMake project

(HIGH)
* modularize the server; the main server's job is to listen to and process packets, anything else should go into attachable, independent modules
* simplify the workflow of processes sitting in the pipe between the server and the client as much as possible

(LOW)
* sanitize input data from ui registration
* code for setting event id offset is TOO UGLY, refactor!!
* set EvtMgr to sleep until the current Evt's reference hits a 0, then wake it up and process next evt; this will save us quite some loops since the EvtMgr doesn't have to be updated anymore!


* path prefix in scriptengine has to be cross-platform
